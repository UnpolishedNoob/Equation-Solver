# Equation-Solver
Console Application Development Using Numerical Methods
<br>
<br>
The Equation-Solver application provides helpful tools for solving mathematical equations using various numerical methods. It supports both linear and non-linear equation solving, as well as matrix inversion.
<br><br>
## Features
### Linear Equation Solving
The application can solve linear equations using the following methods:

- [Jacobi Iterative Method](https://www3.nd.edu/~zxu2/acms40390F12/Lec-7.3.pdf)
- [Gauss-Seidel Iterative Method](https://www3.nd.edu/~zxu2/acms40390F12/Lec-7.3.pdf)
- [Gauss Elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination)
- [Gauss-Jordan Elimination](https://www.craftonhills.edu/current-students/tutoring-center/mathematics-tutoring/matrices-gauss-jordan.pdf)
- [LU Factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition)
### Non-Linear Equation Solving
The application also handles non-linear equations through:

- [Bisection Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method)
- [False Position Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regula_falsi)
- [Secant Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_method)
- [Newton-Raphson Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method)
### Matrix Inversion
For matrix inversion, the application utilizes:

- [Gauss-Jordan Elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination)
